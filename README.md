# WorkMachine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anatma/workmachine.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anatma/workmachine)

WorkMachine allows you to run crowdsourced workflows involving human
intervention. For example, take image transcription can be processed
using an OCR engine but that doesn't assure use that the quality will
be good so we can send it to a human to verify. The human input can
then be used to train the OCR algorithm. The engine is generic enough
to define arbitrary workflows which require human workers.

## Usage

Please take a look in the examples directory for different usages.
